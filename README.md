# Tech-Blog

It is crucial to both create technology and write about it. Developers often engage in both creating new software and fixing existing code, but also devote some time to reading and writing about technical topics, recent developments, and emerging technologies. A quick internet search for any topic covered in a course can yield a vast number of articles and tutorials written by developers of various expertise.

This application is a CMS-style blog similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. This site is built completely from scratch. This application follows the [MVC paradigm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC) in its architectural structure, use [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) as the templating language, [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) as the ORM, and the [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) npm package for authentication.
